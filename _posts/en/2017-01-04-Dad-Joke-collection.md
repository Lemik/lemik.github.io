The dad joke is a pejorative term used to describe a corny, unfunny, or predictable joke, typically a pun. Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are traditionally told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its "dagginess". One of the most common "dad jokes" goes as follows. A child will say to the dad, "I am hungry." To which the dad will reply, "Hi Hungry, I am dad." Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humour from an intentionally unfunny punchline.

I start my collection from this one:

> Me: ‘Dad, make me a sandwich!’ Dad: ‘Abra kadabra, Poof, You’re a sandwich!’

I really enjoy Dad Jokes but don't get all of them. Many of them based on a language slang that makes it not only interesting but also knowledgeable
