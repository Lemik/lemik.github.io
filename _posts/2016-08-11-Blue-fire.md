The Blue Cut Fire, named after the trail where it started, is a wildfire in the Cajon Pass, northeastern San Gabriel Mountains, and Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California.[1] The fire was first reported on August 16, 2016, at 10:36 AM just west of Interstate 15. As of 18 August 2016, the fire has burned 31,600 acres (49.4 sq mi; 127.9 km2) of land.[2] A red flag warning is in effect in the area of the fire with temperatures near 100 °F (38 °C) as well as winds gusting up to 30 miles per hour (48 km/h).[3]

Events[edit]
Shortly after the fire broke out, evacuations began to be ordered for the nearby communities of West Cajon Valley, Lytle Creek, Lone Pine Canyon and Swarthout Canyon.[3] By 3:00 on August 16, less than 6 hours after the fire started, it had spread westward to over 5,500 acres (2,200 ha) forcing additional mandatory evacuation orders for most of Oak Hills, Phelan and Summit Valley.[4]
By Thursday, August 18, the fire had grown to over 31,600 acres (49.4 sq mi; 127.9 km2) and forced the evacuation of over 82,000 residents.[5] The evacuations affected an estimated 34,500 residences. A section of Interstate 15 is still closed.
Two firefighters were transported to the hospital Wednesday morning after becoming trapped while protecting homes in Swarthout Canyon.[6]
In a conference on Wednesday, the incident commander, battalion chief Michael Wakoski, stated that Cajon Pass acts as a natural wind tunnel, creating a funnel that can increase wind speeds by 20–30 miles per hour (32–48 km/h).[7] These winds were causing the fire to spot upwards of a half mile (0.8 km) ahead of itself.[7]
